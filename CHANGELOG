Release 0.9.0 (2020-??-??)
Bug fix:
- Fixed a bug where the monomorphic models were not written in the results for SAVETYPE=END.

Release 0.8.3 (2019-11-22)
Notice:
- Removed the trailing word separator at the end of each line when writing models.
  This additional separator resulted in an empty column when loading the results in R.
Bug fix:
- Fixed a bug in the computation of score thresholds for 2 or more degrees of liberty.
  This issue affected the model selection method "SIGNIF".

Release 0.8.1 (2019-04-06)
Bug fix:
- Fixed the log layout on Windows: The logs now appear in the course of the analysis.
Change of tooling:
- Introduced automated tests for Supervision, RecodePlink and RecodeLFMM.

Release 0.8.0 (2019-03-09)
Improvement:
- Reduced computation time and memory consumption for analyses with population structure.
  Only models involving all population variables are computed in dimensions DIMMAX-1 and DIMMAX.
  Activate this mode by calling the population variables by names beginning with "pop".
Bug fix:
- Fixed a potential hang when computing indices of spatial autocorrelation on Windows.

Release 0.7.1 (2018-12-12)
Bug fix:
- Reactivated compiler optimisation (GCC level -O2), which reduces computation times.
  This option was missing for releases 0.6.x and 0.7.0 on Ubuntu and macOS.
Change of tooling:
- Introduction of code coverage reports with gcov and Sonar.

Release 0.7.0 (2018-11-26)
New feature:
- Added the parameter POPULATIONVAR, which enables including the population structure into the analysis in a semi-automated way.
Bug fix:
- Fixed an error in the computation of Efron's coefficient in case there were missing (molecular or environmental) values.

Release 0.6.1 (2018-11-03)
Notice:
- The option SAVETYPE=SIGNIF is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
Bug fixes:
- Fixed errors in the computation of BIC and Nagelkerke's coefficient of determination;
- Fixed a crash related to relative paths and filenames without extensions;
- Fixed a bug in the output of durations.
Documentation:
- Added an overview of the computed goodness-of-fit statistics to the manual;
Change of tooling:
- Introduction of automated tests with Catch2.

Release 0.6 (2018-06-01)
Change of tooling:
- Migration to GitHub;
- Building with Autotools;
- Continuous integration with Travis and AppVeyor.
Other changes:
- Added an R script for selecting models using the Bonferroni correction;
- Minor corrections of the manual and integration thereof into the code base;
- Renaming of some example files.

Patch 0.5.3 (2016-08-05)
Updated the manual with explanations on using prior knowledge in multivariate models.

Patch 0.5.2 (2015-04-20)
Fixed typos when including some headers on case-sensitive systems.
Added some clarifications in the manual.

Patch 0.5.1 (2015-04-12)
Bug fixes:
- Writing of log file in case of error during initialisation;
- Updating the use of welcome message in Supervision and Recode;
- Update of Makefile.

Release 0.5 (2015-04-07)
Changes of log layout:
- Logs can be printed on the screen and/or written in a file;
- Unconverged models do not appear in logs any longer, but can be written in a separate file;
- An estimation of the remaining computation time is provided during the analysis of selection signatures.

Patch 0.4.5 (2014-08-10)
Minor correction (Makefile update).

Patch 0.4.4 (2014-08-07)
Minor change (to edit the file VERSION only when necessary).

Patch 0.4.3 (2014-06-23)
Bug fix: The program will return an error if the data file contains less samples than specified in the parameter file.

Patch 0.4.2 (2014-04-22)
Minor corrections (on file encoding).

Patch 0.4.1 (2014-04-22)
Minor corrections (on cross-file dependencies).

Release 0.4 (2014-04-17)
Public beta release of Sambada
- Detection of selection signatures with univariate and multivariate models;
- On-the-fly assessment of model significance with Bonferroni correction;
- Analysis of spatial dependance by measuring the level of global and local spatial autocorrelation;
