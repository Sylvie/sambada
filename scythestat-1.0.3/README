Description

  The Scythe Statistical Library is an open source C++ library for
  statistical computation. It includes a suite of matrix manipulation
  functions, a suite of pseudo-random number generators, and a suite
  of numerical optimizers. Programs written using Scythe are generally
  much faster than those written in commonly used interpreted
  languages, such as R, Matlab, and GAUSS; and can be compiled on any
  system with the GNU GCC compiler (and perhaps with other C++
  compilers). One of the primary design goals of the Scythe developers
  has been ease of use for non-expert C++ programmers. Ease of use is
  provided through three primary mechanisms: (1) operator and function
  over-loading, (2) numerous pre-fabricated utility functions, and (3)
  clear documentation and example programs. Additionally, Scythe is
  quite flexible and entirely extensible because the source code is
  available to all users. Scythe is distributed under the GNU General
  Public License, and has been thoroughly tested on Linux and MacOS X.
