Version 1.0
	* Major release.  Change log starts here.

Version 1.0.1
	*	Fixed missing la.h include in rng.h.  This allows rwish method to
		compile.

Version 1.0.2
	* Added LAPACK wrapper for LU decomposition.
	* Added QR decomposition for concrete col-major matrices using LAPACK.
	* Added equation solving via QR decomposition for concrete col-major
		matrices using LAPACK.
	* Added singular value decomposition for concrete col-major matrices
		using LAPACK.
	* Added eigenvalue/vector decomposition for symmetric concrete 
		col-major matrices using LAPACK.
	* Added wrapped_generator class to allow use of external pseudo-random
		uniform number generators with rng.h.
	* Provided support for plain rectangular files in matrix file
		constructor.
	* Added scythe_lapack_internal_error exception type.
	* Changed SetPackageSeed return type in lecuyer.h for mcmcpack
		compatibility.
	* Added return type to GetState in lecuyer.h.
	* Added missing std prefixes in distributions.h.
	* Fixed bugs in lndmvn in distributions.h.
	* Fixed rgamma documentation to indicate it takes shape and rate,
		not shape and scale.
	* Fixed some typos in error checks in ide.h.
	* Changed __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ to __func__ for standards compliance.
	* Made a number of functions inline for mcmcpack compatibility.

Version 1.0.3 
	* Removed extra semi-colons in stat.h macro calls.
	* Changed else if to else in rgamma (rng.h) to eliminate warning.
	* Changed error level of symmetry check in vech (la.h) to match docs.
	* Fixed typo in vech (la.h) doc.
	* Added missing std prefix to sqrt in xpnd (la.h).
	* Changed A = A + .. to A += ... in rwish.
	* Made Matrix::save() const.
	* Added generalized eigenvalue support (experimental and undocumented).
	* Added inlines to lapack wrappers for mcmcpack support.
	* Fixed bugs in median and mode functions that, erroneously, modified 
		matrix views passed to those methods in place.
	* Added an asScalar() method to the matrix class.
	* Updated datablock.h for thread safety with pthreads when
		SCYTHE_PTHREAD compiler flag enabled.
	* Fixed bug in rdirich.
	* Fixed subtle string bug in scythe_exception::what()
	* Various standards compliance fixes.
	* Updated triangularity checks to ensure square.
	* Fixed SCYTHE_DEBUG_LEVEL typo on doc intro page.
	* Added SCYTHE_RPACK flag and some R compatibility code for printing
		warnings and errors, and aborting from C++ back into R.
	* Updated the documentation into to fix some typos, add some
		context, and to reflect new preprocessor flags.
	* Moved to GNU GPL v3.
