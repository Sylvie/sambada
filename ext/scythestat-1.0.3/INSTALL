Scythe installs as header-only C++ library.  Users who do not wish to
install Scythe in this way may also compile the Scythe sources
directly into their applications using the SCYTHE_COMPILE_DIRECT
preprocessor flag.

To install in the default system library folder (typicaly /usr/local/lib).
In the current directory, execute the commands (assuming you have root
write privelages):
	$ ./configure
	$ make install

To install in a local library folder (e.g. /home/myhome/lib).  In the
current directory, execute the commands:
  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/myhome
  $ make install

Make sure /home/myhome/lib is in your include path or compile with
-I/home/myhome/lib when installing in a local folder.

Scythe requires gcc 4.4.7 or greater to compile.
