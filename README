2. Sambada is best built with GCC version 4.2-7.x. We noticed
  Build the programs with
	./configure (or ./configure CC=gcc-7 CXX=g++-7 for explicitly building with GCC 7)
	make
3. Programs are placed in the folder "binaries/".
4. The folder containing all artefacts for the end-user can be built with
	make binary-archive
5. The name of the operating system used for the artefacts' folder can be configured as follows:
	./configure sambadahostsystemname=<osname>
	make binary-archive
as in:
	./configure sambadahostsystemname=OSX
	make binary-archive
