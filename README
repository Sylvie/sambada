D. Building from sources
1. Sources are available on GitHub or on our Web site (see below).
2. Sambada is best built with GCC versions 4.4.7 to 7.x.
  We noticed some incompatibilities with GCC version 8 and with Clang, which are under investigation.
  - Building the programs with Make
        mkdir build
        cd build
        ../configure (or ../configure CC=gcc-7 CXX=g++-7 for explicitly building with GCC 7)
        make
  - Building the programs with CMake
    Please note that this secondary build system might be subject to change.
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make
3. Programs are placed in the folder "binaries/".
4. Also available with Make:
   - Creating the folder containing all artefacts for the end-user
        make binary-archive
   - Some configuration options (see the manual for details)
        ../configure --help
